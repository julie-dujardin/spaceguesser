# spacemap

The map of the Solar System from [spacemap.co](https://spacemap.co), for other
pages: bodies, spacecraft and their orbits over time, in a container of your
own. There is a flat map too, of one body's surface, in a projection of your
choosing.

Distances are kilometres and angles are degrees throughout. Objects are named
by their export id — `naif-399` for Earth, `naif-499` for Mars.

Licensed MPL-2.0. No key, no quota. The credit line the map draws is not
removable: the imagery it shows is published on those terms.

## Getting it

As one script that carries everything it needs — `spacemap.js`, an ES module,
next to `spacemap.iife.js` for pages that want a global instead:

```html
<div id="map" style="height: 500px"></div>
<script type="module">
	import { createMap } from './spacemap.js';
	const map = await createMap({ container: '#map' });
</script>
```

Or from npm, where three.js is yours to provide:

```sh
npm install spacemap three
```

```js
import { createMap } from 'spacemap';
```

## The Solar System map

`createMap` resolves once the map is worth looking at: the opening body placed,
and the one-off quality benchmark done. Small bodies go on streaming in behind
the map it hands back.

```js
const map = await createMap({
	container: '#map',
	view: { body: 'naif-499', lat: 20, lon: 0, distanceKm: 40000 },
	date: new Date('2030-01-01'),
	locale: 'fr'
});
```

### Moving the camera

```js
await map.flyTo({ body: 'naif-599' }); // fly, framing it for you
map.jumpTo({ body: 'naif-599', distanceKm: 2e6 }); // no flight
map.jumpTo({ body: 'naif-399', facing: 'naif-10', elevationDeg: 30 });
map.getCamera(); // { body, lat, lon, distanceKm }
```

`flyTo` resolves when the flight lands. What a target leaves out the map frames
itself, so `{ body }` alone is the ordinary way to move.

Clicking a named surface feature reports it; `panTo` turns to one without
travelling:

```js
map.on('featureselect', (feature) => map.panTo({ body: feature.bodyId, feature }));
```

To place the camera yourself, frame by frame, take it off the map's own
controls:

```js
const hold = map.holdCamera();
map.on('frame', () =>
	hold.set({ position: { body: 'naif-499', offsetKm: [x, y, z] }, target: { body: 'naif-499' } })
);
hold.release();
```

### Events

`on` returns a function that stops listening; `once` and `off` do what they say.

| event                             | when                                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `focuschange`                     | the camera settled on another object               |
| `camera`                          | the camera came to rest                            |
| `featureselect`                   | a nomenclature label was clicked                   |
| `clock`                           | the date, play state, rate or direction changed    |
| `loading` / `progress`            | data is coming in                                  |
| `error`                           | the data could not be loaded                       |
| `notice` / `noticedismiss`        | a condition worth telling the reader about         |
| `layerschange`                    | a layer was switched                               |
| `frame`                           | once per drawn frame                               |
| `contextlost` / `contextrestored` | the GPU context dropped and came back              |
| `datastale`                       | the export was republished while this map was open |
| `userpromoted`                    | how many reader-promoted bodies can be cleared     |

### The clock

`map.clock` is the simulation clock. It starts on wall-clock time unless the
map was opened on a date.

```js
map.clock.pause();
map.clock.setTimeScale(86400); // a day a second
map.clock.toggleDirection();
map.clock.setDate(new Date('2035-06-01'));
map.clock.now();
```

### Drawing on it

Everything you draw is put somewhere by an **anchor**, and the anchor is what
keeps it there as the map moves under it. There are two kinds. A surface anchor
is a longitude, a latitude and a height on a body, and turns with the body as
it spins; an inertial anchor is a body and an offset in kilometres on ecliptic
axes, which travels with the body but does not turn. Either way the drawing
follows what it is drawn on, over any distance and any date.

Six things sit **in space**, measured from an anchor in kilometres:

```js
// Your own element, pinned to a place.
const marker = map.addMarker({
	anchor: { body: 'naif-499', latitude: 18.4, longitude: 77.5, altitudeKm: 0 },
	element: pin,
	align: [0.5, 1],
	occlude: true
});

// A line. Points are kilometres from the anchor, on ecliptic axes.
map.addPolyline({ anchor: { body: 'naif-499' }, points, color: '#66aaff', closed: true });

// An area, filled in its own colour unless you name another.
map.addPolygon({ anchor: { body: 'naif-499' }, points, color: '#ffcc55', fillOpacity: 0.3 });

// A circle round a place, in a plane you turn where you like. It is a ring
// rather than a disc unless you give it a fill: what it is drawn round is
// usually the point.
const ring = map.addCircle({
	anchor: { body: 'naif-499' },
	radiusKm: 20000,
	normal: [0.4, 0, 1],
	widthPx: 3
});
ring.setRadiusKm(30000);

// Text at a place, without an element of your own to build and style.
map.addLabel({ anchor: { body: 'naif-499', latitude: 18.4, longitude: 77.5 }, text: 'Elysium' });

// A picture at a place. It holds its size on screen wherever the camera goes.
map.addIcon({ anchor: { body: 'naif-499' }, url: badge, widthPx: 28, occlude: true });
```

Three more are drawn **on a body**, following its curve and turning with it.
These take longitude and latitude rather than kilometres — the same places the
flat map's shapes take, so one list of points draws on both maps:

```js
map.addSurfacePolyline({ body: 'naif-499', points: track, interpolate: 'geodesic' });
map.addSurfacePolygon({ body: 'naif-499', points: quadrangle, color: '#88ddff' });
map.addSurfaceCircle({ body: 'naif-499', center: { lon: 77.5, lat: 18.4 }, radiusKm: 800 });
```

`boxRing`, `smallCircle` and `graticule`, the flat map's helpers, make point
lists these take; `circlePoints` does the same for a circle in space.
`groundDistanceM` and `bearingDeg` measure between any two places on a body,
given its radius.

Every drawing answers `remove()` and `setVisible()`, a shape answers
`setAnchor()` and `setPoints()`, and `map.clearDrawings()` takes them all away
at once, leaving the map itself alone.

`ShapeStyle` is shared by the shapes: `color`, `widthPx` in screen pixels,
`opacity`, `fill` and `fillOpacity`. A width of zero leaves the outline out, for
an area drawn as a fill alone. The flat map says the same things with the same
words — its version is `FlatShapeStyle`, named apart because a page can hold
both maps at once — so a drawing described once can be handed to either.

Two rules fall out of the scene rather than out of taste. Widths are pixels
because the map spans metres to astronomical units, and a line a kilometre wide
is a wall from low orbit and nothing at all from the next planet out. And a body
hides what is behind it: a shape in space is drawn with the orbit trails and is
cut off at a body's edge exactly as they are, and a shape on a surface stops at
the limb. Markers, labels and icons are HTML rather than geometry and would
otherwise show through the body they sit on, so they take `occlude` to be hidden
when the place they mark turns away.

A shape on a surface floats a little above it by default — half a percent of the
body's radius, which is 17 km at Mars. That clears the relief the map draws, so
the shape reads as lying on the ground rather than sinking into it, and ground
higher than that still comes through, as it should. Give it an `altitudeKm` of
its own for a track flown rather than walked.

Labels and icons are elements, so listen to them directly through their
`element`; they take pointer events only once you pass `interactive: true`,
since the camera is dragged through the layer they sit in. Shapes drawn as
geometry are not clickable.

### Objects of your own

A spacecraft, a station, a body the export has never heard of: your own thing on
the map, moving under its own trajectory and drawn with your own model.

```js
const sat = map.objects.add({
	id: 'my-sat',
	name: 'My Satellite',
	position: tle(line1, line2),
	model: { object3d: myMesh, scaleM: 12, minPx: 24 },
	label: true
});

map.objects.get('my-sat');
map.objects.all();
sat.remove();
map.objects.clear();
```

**The map ships no model loader.** `object3d` is a three.js `Object3D` you have
already built or loaded — a mesh of your own, or a GLB you put through your own
`GLTFLoader`. That keeps a loader, its Draco and KTX2 decoders and their WASM out
of a bundle every reader downloads, for a feature most embeds never use, and it
leaves you the loader you already have rather than one this package chose for
you. From npm, three.js is a peer dependency: your copy is the map's copy, and
there is nothing to reconcile. From the CDN script the map's three.js is bundled
inside it and private, so a page that builds a model loads its own copy; that
works, since all the map does with the object is put it in a scene and place it,
but the package is the way to do this without two copies of three.js on the page.

`scaleM` is how big the model is drawn, in metres across its longest dimension
— the real size, arrays and booms deployed. Left out, it is drawn at the size it
was built. A twelve-metre satellite is nothing at all from a planetary view, so
`minPx` gives it a floor in pixels: below that it is drawn bigger than life,
above it, true to size.

Four constructors say where an object is, and any of them can be used anywhere
an anchor can — a marker, a drawing, a camera pose:

```js
import { elements, fixed, kmToAu, samples, tle } from 'spacemap';

// Parked: on the ground, or at an offset from a body's centre.
fixed({ body: 'naif-499', latitude: 18.4, longitude: 77.5, altitudeKm: 0 });
fixed({ body: 'naif-499', offsetKm: [0, 20000, 0] });

// A list of states, read between.
samples({ body: 'naif-399', samples: [{ jd, km: [x, y, z] }, ...] });

// A Keplerian orbit, propagated from its epoch.
elements({
	body: 'naif-399',
	elements: {
		a: kmToAu(6878), // semi-major axis, in AU
		e: 0.001,
		i: 51.6, // inclination, degrees
		om: 247, // longitude of the ascending node
		w: 130, // argument of pericentre
		ma: 325, // mean anomaly at the epoch
		n: 5658, // mean motion, degrees a day
		epoch: 2460584.5, // Julian date
		equatorial: true // referenced to Earth's equator, not the ecliptic
	}
});

// Two lines of a NORAD element set, propagated with SGP4 round Earth.
tle(line1, line2);
```

Offsets and states are kilometres on ecliptic J2000 axes, measured from the body
they name — the Sun when they name none. Orbital elements are the export's own,
which means the semi-major axis is in astronomical units: the one distance on
this surface that is not in kilometres, because that is how elements are quoted
everywhere the map reads them. `kmToAu` is there for that line alone. Set
`equatorial` when the angles are referenced to Earth's equator, as a TLE's are.

Between two states the path is a cubic through both of them, tangent to the
slope their neighbours imply, which is the curve a coasting object actually
follows — a straight line between states would cut every corner of an orbit.
States may be given in any order and at any spacing; they are read at their own
dates. **Outside the dates the states cover, the object is not drawn.** A list
that has run out is not evidence of where anything is, and the map would rather
show nothing than park a probe at its last known place. A TLE is the same the
other way: SGP4 propagates it as far as you ask, accuracy falling away from the
element set's epoch, and a date it cannot be propagated to — a decayed satellite
— leaves the object undrawn. Keplerian elements are defined at every date, so an
object on them is always somewhere.

What an object takes part in, and what it does not, is worth saying plainly. It
is drawn in the scene beside the bodies, so **a body in front of it hides it and
it hides what is behind it**, and it holds its place as the map's origin moves
from body to body. `label: true` writes its name beside it in the map's own
label style, `occludeLabel` hiding that while the object is round the far side.

It is **not** a body. `getBody` does not know it, `flyTo` cannot reach it, a
click does not select it — the map resolves a click through a pass over its own
objects, which a host object has no id in — and it draws no orbit trail of its
own. Those all read the published catalogue, and an object of yours is not in
it. What you get instead is its position, at any date you like, which is enough
to do the rest yourself:

```js
sat.positionKm(map.clock.jd); // [x, y, z] km from the body it is measured from

// Following it: its position is an anchor, so a held camera takes it as a
// target, and a standoff behind it as its own place.
const hold = map.holdCamera();
map.on('frame', ({ jd }) => {
	const km = sat.positionKm(jd);
	if (!km) return;
	hold.set({
		position: { body: sat.position.body, offsetKm: [km[0] + 500, km[1], km[2] + 200] },
		target: sat.position
	});
});

// A trail: sample the trajectory and hand the points to a polyline.
const points = [];
for (let i = -60; i <= 0; i++) points.push(sat.positionKm(map.clock.jd + i / 1440));
map.addPolyline({ anchor: { body: 'naif-399' }, points: points.filter(Boolean), fade: true });
```

`clearDrawings()` leaves objects alone — they are not drawings — and
`map.objects.clear()` takes only them.

### Its own imagery on a body

A body the map already knows can wear your pictures instead of the export's:

```js
map.setBodyAppearance('naif-499', { surface: url, night: url, clouds: url });
map.setBodyAppearance('naif-499', {}); // back to the map's own
```

Each is a URL the browser can load — an equirectangular map, east to the right,
longitude 0 in the middle, which is how every body's imagery is drawn. `night`
is the lights on the unlit side, `clouds` a layer over the surface whose alpha
is the cover; a body with neither of its own gets one built for it. The set is
replaced whole, so what a call leaves out goes back to the map's own picture.

**A picture given here is what the body wears at every distance.** The map picks
its own imagery by how much of the screen the body fills, stepping up a tier as
you approach; there is nothing to pick once a host has said what the body looks
like, so that pass stops fetching for it and, every frame, checks that what is on
the body is still yours — a system reload, a defocus or a lost GPU context puts
it straight back.

The flat map needs nothing of its own for this: its pictures are layers already,
and `addRasterLayer` puts one of yours over or in place of them.

### Layers

What the map draws is a set of layers, each switched by id — the kinds of
object first, then the chrome drawn around them:

`planets`, `dwarfPlanets`, `moons`, `asteroids`, `comets`, `spacecraft`,
`satellites` (the ones round Earth), `debris`, `orbits`, `labels` (the names of
objects), `nomenclature` (the names of places on them) and `stars` (the sky
behind everything).

```js
const map = await createMap({
	container: '#map',
	layers: { asteroids: false, comets: false, debris: false }
});

map.setLayerVisible('moons', false);
map.isLayerVisible('moons'); // false
map.getLayers(); // every id, so a switcher need not spell them out
```

**A layer switched off in the options is never downloaded; a layer switched off
later is only hidden.** The two are different asks and the map answers them
differently on purpose. `layers` at open time is what an embed about Mars
wants: the belts, the comets and the thirty thousand Earth satellites are not
fetched at all, and the map opens on a fraction of the data. `setLayerVisible`
is what a reader's checkbox wants: it lands on the next frame and never asks
the network for anything, whichever way it is switched.

The corollary is worth saying plainly: **switching on a layer that was off at
open time shows nothing**, because there is nothing to show. Switch off in the
options what the map is not for; switch at runtime what the reader is to have a
say in.

Two groups are hidden rather than skipped. `planets` and `dwarfPlanets` share
one file with the Sun, so leaving them out saves no download. `satellites` and
`debris` share one file with each other, so the download is only skipped when
neither is wanted.

The asteroids are one layer, not five. The export files them by orbit class,
and those classes do not divide cleanly into the dynamical families
`Body.orbitClass` reports — two of them belong to no family at all — so a
family switch would leave objects answering to nothing. Read `orbitClass` off a
body to tell the families apart.

Hiding is a drawing decision and nothing else. The Sun lights the scene
whatever is off, `flyTo` reaches a hidden body, and `getBody` still knows it.

The flat map has layers too, of its own: the pictures wrapped round a body and
the lines drawn over them. Those depend on the body on screen and carry their
own names, so it reads them out whole:

```js
flat.getLayers(); // ['surface', 'clouds', 'night', 'graticule', 'nomenclature']
flat.layers; // the same, with a label, a kind and a credit each
flat.setLayerVisible('clouds', false);
flat.isLayerVisible('clouds');
flat.on('layerschange', (layers) => redraw(layers));
```

## The flat map

One body's surface, drawn flat, with layers you can switch and drawings of your
own on top.

```js
const flat = await createFlatMap({
	container: '#flat',
	body: 'naif-399',
	projection: 'orthographic',
	centerLon: 10,
	zoom: 2
});

flat.setLayerVisible('clouds', false);
flat.setProjection('equirectangular');
flat.addCircle({ at: { lon: 12.5, lat: 41.9 }, radiusDeg: 5, stroke: '#f80' });
flat.on('click', (at) => at && console.log(at.lon, at.lat));
```

## Panoramas

A rover's panorama from the inside, with arrows along its traverse. The
three-dimensional part is all the SDK draws; the date, the place, a list to
pick from or a map of the traverse are the page's to build.

Which bodies have panoramas, and where each one stands, can be read before a
view exists — what a page picking one for the reader needs, since `createPanorama`
opens the body's first unless told which:

```js
import { fetchPanoramaIndex, fetchPanoramas } from 'spacemap';

await fetchPanoramaIndex(); // every body with coverage, and the missions on it
const entries = await fetchPanoramas('naif-499'); // every panorama on Mars
const pick = entries[(Math.random() * entries.length) | 0];
const view = await createPanorama({ container: '#panorama', body: 'naif-499', at: pick.id });
```

```js
const view = await createPanorama({
	container: '#panorama',
	body: 'naif-499',
	// A panorama's id, or its `time,lat,lon` key; the body's first when omitted.
	at: 'curiosity-n_l000_0016_edr003cyltsm0078_drivem3'
});

view.getPanoramas(); // every panorama of the body, mission by mission in time order
view.getNeighbours(); // the previous and next one on this traverse, with bearing and distance
view.on('load', (entry) => console.log(entry.sol, entry.time, entry.lat, entry.lon));
view.on('viewchange', ({ heading, pitch, fov }) => {});
view.setView({ heading: 90 });
await view.open(view.getPanoramas()[3]);
await view.step('next');
```

Pressing an arrow opens the panorama it points at, unless `followArrows` is
false: then only the `step` event fires, for a page that keeps the panorama in
its own URL. The `arrows` event says where each arrow landed on screen, for a
label beside it. `interactive: false` turns the drag, pinch, wheel and arrow
keys off; `arrows: false` and `setArrowsVisible` hide the arrows.

Limits keep the reader inside part of the sweep, or at one zoom. Headings run
clockwise from the first to the second, so `[300, 60]` is the arc across
north; a pair of equal values locks that axis.

```js
createPanorama({ container: '#panorama', body: 'naif-499', limits: { pitch: [-20, 20] } });
view.setLimits({ heading: [300, 60], fov: [60, 60] }); // ±60° of north, no zoom
view.setLimits({}); // free again
```

## Restricting the map

Both maps take restrictions on what the reader may do. Each gesture is a
handler of its own, the way Mapbox has them:

```js
map.scrollZoom.disable();
map.scrollZoom.isEnabled(); // false
map.dragRotate.enable();
```

The Solar System map has `dragRotate`, `scrollZoom`, `keyboard`, `bodySelect`
and `featureSelect`; the flat map has `dragPan` and `scrollZoom`. They can be
set as the map opens, either one at a time or all at once:

```js
createMap({ container: '#map', interactive: false }); // every gesture off
createMap({ container: '#map', interactions: { scrollZoom: false } }); // one
```

`limits` says how far the reader may go. On the Solar System map that is a
distance from the focused body, a band of it to look down from, and the objects
a click may focus:

```js
const map = await createMap({
	container: '#map',
	limits: {
		minDistanceKm: 8000,
		maxDistanceKm: 400000,
		minLat: -40,
		maxLat: 40,
		minLon: -60,
		maxLon: 60,
		bodies: ['naif-399', 'naif-301']
	}
});

map.setLimits({ maxDistanceKm: 1e6 }); // replaced whole, not merged
map.getLimits();
```

On the flat map it is a zoom range and a band the middle of the frame stays in:

```js
flat.setLimits({ minZoom: 2, maxZoom: 8, minLon: -30, maxLon: 30 });
flat.getLimits();
```

**Limits gate reader input and nothing else.** `flyTo`, `jumpTo`, `panTo`,
`setView` and a held camera go where they are told, outside the limits
included; the reader's next gesture brings the map back inside. This is a
deliberate departure from Mapbox, where `maxBounds` holds the map whatever
moved it. Restrict what the reader may reach, and drive the map yourself to
anywhere you like.

A longitude band may run through the antimeridian: 170 to −170 is the twenty
degrees across it. One edge alone leaves the other at the antimeridian.

`setLimits` replaces the whole set, so `setLimits({})` lifts the restrictions
again. Angles are degrees and distances kilometres, as everywhere else.

### Cooperative gestures

A map inside a page the reader scrolls past can hand the plain gestures back to
the page:

```js
createMap({ container: '#map', cooperativeGestures: true });
```

The wheel then scrolls the page unless ctrl (⌘ on a Mac) is held, and one
finger drags the page rather than the map — two fingers still move it. A hint
says so whenever the plain gesture is tried; `messages` rewords it through
`cooperative_wheel`, `cooperative_wheel_mac` and `cooperative_touch`. The
handler is `map.cooperativeGestures`, on and off like any other.

## Controls

A control is anything that builds an element when it is added:

```js
map.addControl(
	{
		onAdd() {
			const button = document.createElement('button');
			button.textContent = 'Home';
			button.onclick = () => map.flyTo({ body: 'naif-399' });
			return button;
		}
	},
	'top-left'
);
```

Corners are `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left` and `bottom-right`;
top-right unless the control or the caller names another. `removeControl` takes
one back off — except the credit line, which throws. The credit line sits
bottom-right; `attributionPosition` moves it to another corner, for a page
whose own chrome wants that one.

The panorama view takes controls the same way. The credit line is the only control the SDK ships. Zoom buttons, a layer
switcher or a clock are the page's to build, in its own look, from the calls
this document describes: `flyTo` and `jumpTo`, `getLayers` and
`setLayerVisible` with the `layerschange` event, and `map.clock` with the
`clock` event.

## Where the data comes from

Both maps read the published export. `dataUrl` and `imagesUrl` point them
somewhere else — your own mirror, or a local copy while you develop. They are
page-wide: the last map created sets them, and data already fetched keeps the
origin it came from.

`locale` picks localized names; `messages` replaces the English wording the map
renders itself, one key at a time.

## Finishing with a map

```js
map.remove();
```
